Prepared under the pressure of time as part of a ReactJS tutorial from a John Smilga. Thank you, John. Oddly enough, the CocktailDB is a real API you can use to get some potentially true info on drinks so you can get your drink on sooner so if that sounds interesting make sure you click that subscribe button and the notification bell so you don't miss any of my future videos ok one more youtube video and I'll freak for real.
