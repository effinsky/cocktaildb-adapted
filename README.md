Prepared under the pressure of time as part of a ReactJS tutorial from a John Smilga. Thank you, John. Oddly enough, the CocktailDB is a real API you can use to get some potentially true info on drinks so you can get your drink on sooner so if that sounds interesting make sure you click all the buttons you find until you find a drink you like.

This was prepared mainly for fun and for job interviews. Both will have me evolve this mini project into where we get stuff other than cocktail info, maybe music artist info instead, from my own backend. This text will then come from that backend as well. We will have forms to submit artist info and have that sent over to the back end thru REST and persisted in... probably MongoDB.

For Netlify deployment the build script must be modified to: "build": "CI= react-scripts build",
